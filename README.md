This project was created specifically to learn how to work better with the [react](https://en.reactjs.org/) and API.

This project works on the basis of the [Star Wars API server](https://swapi.co/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
